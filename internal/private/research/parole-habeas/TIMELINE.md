# Parole / habeas workspace — TIMELINE

**Classification:** internal/private. Not a live calendar. Dates below are from `clocks.json`, `docket.json`, `events.jsonl`, filed PDFs, and the private immigration notes. Where those conflict, clocks and filed orders win.

**As of:** 2026-10-28. Today’s open question is whether Santa Clara has ruled on Matter 19 (C2604791) after the Oct. 1, 2026 CRC 4.551 calendar. No ruling PDF is in the repo.

Labels: **FACT** (on a filed paper or identity JSON), **USER REPORT** (true-up / prenup notes without the source PDF), **INFERENCE**, **MISSING**.

## A. Conviction and sentence (C1761642)

| Date | Event | Label | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2017-10-25 | Santa Clara criminal case **C1761642** filing date as later reported by Accurate | USER REPORT (CRA) | Matter 29 accuracy audit, CR p4. **Certified docket missing.** |
| 2018-01-12 | Sentencing, Hon. Arthur Bocanegra. Count 2 **PC § 289(a)(1)(A)**, 4 years midterm; Count 3 **PC § 220(a)(1)**, 4 years concurrent. Total **6 years CDCR**. Probation denied. Counts 1 (PC §§ 664/209(b)(1)) and 4 (PC §§ 664/242/243.4(a)) dismissed. **§ 290** registration ordered. Criminal protective order; notes say it appears to expire Jan. 12, 2028 | USER REPORT | `internal/private/prenup/IMMIGRATION_NOTES.md`. **Minute-order PDF not stored.** |
| 2018 (post-sentence) | Direct appeal? | MISSING | No notice of appeal, opinion, or remittitur in the repo. If none was filed, the judgment became final 60 days after sentencing (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.308) — **about Mar. 13, 2018**. That date, if true, starts the AEDPA one-year clock on a 2254 attacking the **conviction**. |
| ~2018–2020 | CDCR term served. CDC No. **BF3571** | FACT | Matter 19 petition; HOPE homework Bates (TP ID# BF3571) |

Offense date is **not** in the repo. Filing in October 2017 plus a January 2018 sentence implies a crime **on or after July 1, 2013**, which is the PC § 3000(b)(2)(B) cutoff (10-year parole “shall” rather than “not exceeding”). Confirm from the complaint / probation report.

## B. Parole start and immigration overlay

| Date | Event | Label | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| **2020-12-02** | Released from prison onto CDCR parole. This is the date used everywhere: Matter 19, Matter 9 FAC, Accurate CR (“RELEASED FROM PRISON ONTO PAROLE”) | FACT (pled / CRA) | Matter 19 `key_facts`; Accurate CR p5–6. **CDCR release chrono missing.** |
| 2020-12-02 + 10 years | Controlling discharge date pled as **2030-12-02** | FACT (pled) | Matter 9 FAC; Matter 19. Follows PC § 3000(b)(2)(B) for a § 667.5(c)(11) offense (sexual penetration, PC § 289). Matter 9 tentative adopted that construction May 29, 2026 |
| 2021-02-08 | Immigration Court, Aurora, CO (Judge Elizabeth McGrail): removable; asylum/withholding denied; **CAT deferral granted**; removal to Cameroon ordered; both sides waived appeal — **final** | USER REPORT | Prenup immigration notes. **IJ order not in repo.** |
| 2021-03-05 | HOPE intake (Stockton). Pled as the date HOPE represented an achievable path to treatment completion | FACT (pled) | Matter 5 FAC `key_facts` |
| 2021-04-30 / 2021-05-10 | ICE I-220B issued; released from ICE custody onto order of supervision | USER REPORT | Prenup notes |
| 2021 (undated) | Prior supervising agent approved travel to Reno for a church service — later used as a comparator in Matter 21 | FACT (pled) | Matter 21 `key_facts` |

From Dec. 2, 2020 through Oct. 28, 2026 is **about 5 years 11 months** on parole. Policy 19-03’s “6.5 years” bar, as quoted on the 1502-DR in Nov. 2025, counted “approximately 4 years.” That internal count has never been reconciled in a CDCR letter in this repo.

## C. Supervision, technicals, and holds (2022–2025)

| Date | Event | Label | Source |

| 2024-11-01 ff. | **Parole-violation hold** after the arrest. Duration pled as **five days** (with the booking / blood draw) | FACT (pled in Matter 1 F&R; used in Matter 32 valuation) | `32.valuation.json` pin: E.D. Cal. 2:25-cv-01460, ECF 23 at 2:16–17. **DAPO hold paperwork missing.** |
| 2024-11-05 | CHP issues PC § 849(b)(1) Detention Certificate (Dublin CHP-01991 / File 202400898) — detention only, insufficient grounds for a complaint. DA filed nothing | FACT | Cluster 1 lock |
| ~Halloween 2024 or 2025 | Agent Urrea **5-day curfew detention**. Matter 13 describes it as pretextual Halloween curfew; year is not pinned in `matter.json` | FACT (pled) / year MISSING | Matter 13. Closed with prejudice Jun. 29, 2026 |
| 2025-01-24 / 2025-02-11 | DMV APS hearing / Candelaria decision; one-year Class A suspension Feb. 20, 2025 – Feb. 19, 2026 | FACT | Matter 33 |

| 2025 (four incidents) | Technicals: missed HOPE sessions, uncharged GPS. Resolved by verbal reprimand or PACT. **No revocation** | FACT (pled on the 1502-DR / Matter 19) | Matter 19 `key_facts` |
| 2025-08 | CTM: Palacios “ringleader” / “abhorrent” characterizations in front of Chow, Noguchi, Derrick | FACT (pled) | Matters 3, 5 |
| **2025-08-27** | Prior Santa Clara habeas (3-year abstract vs. 10-year statute) **denied by Judge Geffon** | FACT (pled) | Matter 19 events.jsonl; petition CRC 4.552 disclosure. **Order PDF missing. Case number missing.** |
| 2025-11-14 | Moua authors CDCR **Form 1502-DR** (Rev. 01/22). Noguchi electronically signs as supervisor (badge 7284). Discharge review date printed **Dec. 1, 2025**. Dodd ratifies **Nov. 19, 2025** (pled) | FACT | Matter 15 `key_facts`; Matter 9 FAC Ex. A. Supervisor comments on the face of the form name **“Eagan.”** |

| **2025-12-01** | Discharge Review Report operative date. Denial: Policy 19-03 10-year term / “only completed approximately 4 years of the required 6.5 years”; incomplete treatment; technicals; unemployment | FACT | Matter 9 tentative quoting FAP Ex. A p.4 |

No **formal parole revocation** (Morrissey hearing → return to prison) is documented. The two completed **holds** (Nov. 1, 2024; Halloween curfew) are the closest events. Matter 30 later alleges a **fabricated** Mar. 31, 2026 treatment violation that was cited for an inter-county **transfer**, not a revocation.

## E. Forward clocks that still matter to habeas strategy

From `clocks.json` after the Oct. 28 true-up. Vacated clocks omitted.

| Date | Matter | Clock | Why it matters here |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-10-01 (open / derived overdue) | 19 | HC-004 30-day ruling calendar | Until a ruling exists, a federal 2254 of the discharge claim is **unexhausted** |

## F. What is *not* on this timeline

- A signed **CDCR discharge**. Accurate still said “currently on parole” on Oct. 14, 2026. Matter 19 is still captioned as seeking discharge.
- A **Morrissey** revocation hearing or a return-to-prison.
- A **federal** habeas petition, a Ninth Circuit habeas appeal, or a California Supreme Court habeas.
- The **Geffon** 2025 file.
- A **direct appeal** of C1761642.

Those gaps are the missing-records list in `HABEAS-OPTIONS.md`.
