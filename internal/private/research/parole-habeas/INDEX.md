## Snapshot the rest of the analysis depends on

These are **pled or documented** facts, not new findings.

| Fact | Source | Confidence |
|---|---|---|
| Convicted Jan. 12, 2018, Santa Clara C1761642, Hon. Arthur Bocanegra: Count 2 **PC § 289(a)(1)(A)** (4 years midterm) and Count 3 **PC § 220(a)(1)** (4 years concurrent). Total 6 years CDCR. Probation denied. Counts 1 and 4 dismissed. § 290 registration ordered. | `internal/private/prenup/IMMIGRATION_NOTES.md` (minute order uploaded 2026-10-04; original not stored in repo) | High as to statutes/term; **the minute order PDF is missing from the repo** |
| Released to CDCR parole **Dec. 2, 2020**. Controlling discharge date pled as **Dec. 2, 2030** (10-year statutory maximum). | Matter 19 `matter.json`; Matter 9 FAC; Accurate report (Matter 29) | High |
| Still on parole as of the Oct. 28, 2026 true-up. No CDCR discharge certificate is in the repo. Accurate’s Oct. 14, 2026 report still says “CURRENTLY ON PAROLE.” | Matter 19 status; Matter 29 accuracy audit | High that the portfolio treats him as on parole; **certificate missing** |
| CDC No. BF3571. Supervised at various times by Stockton 2 GPS (Moua / Noguchi / Derrick / Rojo / Urrea) and, after July 2, 2026, Santa Clara GPS. | Matters 15, 19, 30 | High |
| **No federal habeas petition has ever been filed.** Successive-petition bar of 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b) is not yet triggered. | Full matter crawl | High |
| Matter 19 (C2604791) is the **only live state habeas**. CRC 4.551(a)(6)(B) 30-day calendar from the Sep. 1, 2026 HC-004 ran through **Oct. 1, 2026**. **No ruling PDF ingested as of Oct. 28, 2026.** Status is UNCERTAIN. | Matter 19 `matter.json` (last_updated 2026-10-28); PR #1039 | High as to the gap |
| Recommended next **state** paper, if the clerk file still shows no ruling: petition for **writ of mandate** in the Court of Appeal, Sixth Appellate District, to compel Santa Clara to rule — **not** an original COA habeas that itself discharges him or orders a new review. The pending habeas prays **(1) immediate discharge** on futility **or (2)** a new lawful review on a date certain; ranking in `coa-6th/MEMO.md` § 2. Drafts are in `coa-6th/`. **Do not file from this INDEX.** | `coa-6th/MEMO.md` | Recommendation only; user must pull the live docket first |

## 1. Core habeas / discharge vehicles (Cluster 4 — Administrative Writs & Habeas)

Numbered cluster 4 is the UI bucket (`internal/src/data/clusters.js`). It is not the named graph in `index/clusters.json`.

### Matter 19 — live habeas (discharge)

| | |
|---|---|
| Caption | *Newanforbi v. Macomber* (petition caption also names Keely Dodd) |
| Court / no. | Santa Clara Super. Ct. **C2604791** (trial court no. C1761642) |
| Judge | Hon. Robert Hawk |
| Filed | Apr. 3, 2026 (signed Mar. 31, 2026) |
| Proceeding | State habeas, Pen. Code § 1473 — immediate unconditional discharge |
| Status | **ACTIVE / under submission.** HC-004 filed in person Sep. 1, 2026. Oct. 1 ruling calendar passed. **No ruling PDF. Do not treat the petition as granted or denied.** |
| Live clock | `19-deadline-1` 2026-10-01, status `open` (derived overdue). Actor: court. |
| Key orders | **Jul. 2, 2026** Order Extending Time (CRC 4.551(i)) — ruling deadline **Aug. 1, 2026**, which lapsed with no ruling. Path: `/documents/opinions/Newanforbi Habeas - Santa Clara Sup Ct - Order Extending Time Jul 2 2026.pdf` |
| What it asks | **Primary:** vacate the Dec. 1, 2025 Form 1502-DR and **immediate discharge** on a futility theory (Policy 19-03 blanket bar; boilerplate 1502-DR naming **Eagan**; prior denials; record supporting discharge). **Alternatively:** a new lawful individualized review on Form 3043 / 15 CCR § 3574 within a date certain (suggest 30 days). Declare Policy 19-03 invalid as a ground. **Candid ranking** (*Prather* / *Masoner I* / Matter 9): plead both; expect the court to grant (2) if anything. See `coa-6th/MEMO.md` § 2. |
| Prior habeas disclosed | Apr./May 2025 petition (3-year abstract vs. 10-year statute), **denied Aug. 27, 2025 by Judge Geffon**. No Geffon order PDF in the repo. |
| Risk flags in the petition itself | Cites ***In re Leman*, 66 Cal.App.5th 200 (2021)** — **known fabrication; do not reuse.** Claims “without a single arrest” over five years of parole — **in tension with the Nov. 1, 2024 CHP arrest** (Matter 32 / 20 / 33), even though that arrest was later reclassified under PC § 849(b)(1). Supervisor comments on the 1502-DR name **“Eagan”** on the face of the exhibit; some pleadings silently substituted “Newanforbi.” |
| Court of Appeal next step (draft only) | If the live clerk file still shows no 4.551(a)(8) ruling: **writ of mandate** in the Sixth District to compel a ruling — not original COA habeas. Packet: `coa-6th/`. **Do not file from the draft.** |

### Matter 10 — closed habeas (treatment length)

| | |
|---|---|
| Caption | *Newanforbi v. Macomber* |
| Court / no. | Santa Clara Super. Ct. **C2602632** (trial court no. C1761642) |
| Judge | Hon. Robert Hawk |
| Filed | Feb. 23, 2026 |
| Status | **CLOSED.** Order denying **without prejudice**, Apr. 27, 2026 |
| Holding | Sought relief from continued SOMP participation under PC § 3008(d)(2). Denied for **failure to exhaust**: program length is determined by the certified treatment professional in consultation with the parole officer, *then* approved by the court. Futility (citing *Dwyer*) was rejected because the determination is individualized. Path: `/documents/matter-10/ORDER_DENYING_PETITION_C2602632.pdf` |

### Matter 9 — closed mandate (same discharge review)

| | |
|---|---|
| Caption | *Newanforbi v. Macomber* |
| Court / no. | Sacramento Super. Ct. **26WM000028** |
| Judge | Hon. James P. Arguelles, Dept. 13A |
| Filed | Jan. 30, 2026 (FAC ~Feb. 2 / e-filed Mar. 31, 2026) |
| Status | **CLOSED.** Demurrer sustained **without leave to amend** May 29, 2026 (tentative became the order). Counsel for CDCR directed to prepare a formal order and judgment. |
| Holding (tentative, 7 pp.) | (1) Habeas, not mandate, is the proper vehicle because a parolee is in constructive custody (*Ex Parte Bandmann*). (2) Even treating it as mandate, **no ministerial duty**: PC § 3000(b)(2)(B) requires a **10-year** parole term for specified § 667.5(c) offenses, including sexual penetration (§ 667.5(c)(11) / PC § 289). Petitioner has not served 10 years. The court also noted it is “not clear why CDCR undertook the early parole review process.” Path: `/documents/matter-09/CU_26WM000028_e91359ab-2598-4573-a45a-fa7893fc4cb07.pdf` |
| Why it matters for federal habeas | This is the most developed **adverse construction** of the 10-year term. A later 2254 attacking the Dec. 2025 denial as a matter of *state* discharge law has to get past both this holding and *Swarthout v. Cooke*. |

### Matter 11 — closed federal § 1983 (Policy 19-03)

| | |
|---|---|
| Caption | *Newanforbi v. Macomber* |
| Court / no. | USDC E.D. Cal. (case no. TBD in identity JSON; never assigned a live docket in the index) |
| Filed | Mar. 2, 2026 |
| Status | **DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE** Jun. 29, 2026, FRCP 41(a)(1)(A)(i) |
| Claims | Procedural due process against Policy 19-03’s 6.5-year bar after § 3574. Equitable relief only. Pled around *Heck* via *Wilkinson v. Dotson*. |
| Habeas note | A claim that “success would necessarily mean earlier discharge” is habeas-core under *Nettles*. This filing was § 1983, then abandoned with prejudice. |

## 3. November 1, 2024 arrest while on parole (Cluster 1)

Live: **20, 24, 32, 33**. Archives: 1, 2, 7, 8.

These are not habeas cases. They matter because (a) the arrest happened **on parole**, (b) Matter 1’s F&R recorded a **parole-violation hold**, and (c) Accurate later used C1761642 + “currently on parole” in a 2026 background check.

| Matter | Court / case no. | Status | Parole hook | Key orders / clocks |

This is CHP arrest evidence. It is **not** a CDCR parole packet. Parole-hold proof, if it exists, is more likely in a CDCR/DAPO file that has not been produced.

## 4. Background-check use of parole / C1761642

| Matter | Court / case no. | Status | Parole hook | Clocks |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **29** *Newanforbi v. Amazon / Accurate* | N.D. Cal. **4:26-cv-09249-ASK** (Krishnan; removed from Alameda 26CV201554) | **ACTIVE.** Dkt. 19 MTD; hearing **Nov. 18, 2026, 1:30 p.m.** | Accurate consumer report (search 496623722, completed **Oct. 14, 2026**) lists Santa Clara **C1761642**, release **12/02/2020**, and **“CURRENTLY ON PAROLE.”** No source or verification date for the parole line. Five other CRAs returned Santa Clara Clear/No Record. Audit: `internal/docs/matter-29/matter29-accurate-accuracy-audit.md` | 26(f) **Nov. 6**; ADR Nov. 10; Joint CMS Nov. 24; CMC **Dec. 1**. Accurate reinvestigation clock satisfied Oct. 28 (user report: “Newansorbi” alias removed; NSOR completeness **not** independently verified). Open PR #1036 is the private research room |

C1761642 itself is **not** a portfolio matter number. It is the 2018 criminal case. The certified docket is still an internal target (Matter 29 60-day calendar, Oct. 20: “order the certified Santa Clara docket”).

## 5. Immigration overlay (not a filed matter)

Private notes only: `internal/private/prenup/IMMIGRATION_NOTES.md`.

- Immigration Court, Aurora, Colorado, Judge Elizabeth McGrail, **Feb. 8, 2021**: removable under INA §§ 237(a)(1)(B) and 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) (aggravated felony). Asylum / withholding denied. **CAT deferral granted.** Removal to Cameroon ordered; both sides waived appeal — **final Feb. 8, 2021**.
- ICE Form I-220B Order of Supervision Apr. 30, 2021; released May 10, 2021.
- This is a **second custody system** (ICE OSUP) sitting on top of CDCR parole. It is not CDCR habeas, but it is why PC § 1473.7 and vacatur of C1761642 matter, and why Matter 20’s U-visa writ is in the parole conversation.

1. **“Zero arrests” (Matter 19 petition ¶ 3) vs. Nov. 1, 2024 CHP arrest** (later PC § 849(b)(1) detention certificate Nov. 5, 2024). Any habeas or 2254 that repeats “no arrests” will be impeached with Matter 1/20/32/33.
2. **“Zero revocations”** is consistent with the Form 1502-DR’s verbal-reprimand / PACT handling, but **does not erase** (a) the Nov. 1 **parole hold**, (b) the Halloween **5-day detention** (Matter 13), or (c) the Mar. 31, 2026 telehealth write-up (Matter 30).
3. **Eagan vs. Newanforbi** on the 1502-DR supervisor comments. The form is the exhibit. Pleadings that silently substitute the petitioner’s name are a candor problem (`internal/docs/cross_matter_risk_index.json`).
4. **Abstract “3 years” vs. PC § 3000 10-year term.** Geffon denied that challenge Aug. 27, 2025 (order missing). Matter 9 independently held the 10-year statute controls.
5. ***In re Leman*** is in the Matter 19 petition and in `matter.json` `key_facts`. It is a **known-fabricated** cite. Do not put it in any new filing.

## 9. Missing records (short list; full list in HABEAS-OPTIONS)

Priority pulls:

1. Santa Clara clerk file for **C2604791** — any order after Jul. 2, 2026, especially after Oct. 1, 2026.
2. Judge **Geffon** Aug. 27, 2025 denial (the 2025 term-length habeas) and the petition it decided.
3. Certified **C1761642** docket, abstract of judgment, sentencing transcript, and the Jan. 12, 2018 minute order.
4. **CDCR discharge certificate** (or a letter that there is none) and the live DAPO face sheet / controlling discharge date.
5. CDCR **Policy 19-03 (Amended)** as promulgated, not just as quoted on the 1502-DR.
6. Form **3043** (or proof none was used) for the Nov./Dec. 2025 review.
7. DAPO records of the **Nov. 1, 2024 parole hold** and the **Halloween 5-day hold**.
8. Direct-appeal / habeas history in the California Court of Appeal and California Supreme Court (needed for 2254 exhaustion).
9. Matter 9 **formal order and judgment** (tentative says CDCR counsel shall prepare them).
10. Matter 5 **CCP § 581d judgment** (Matter 28 stay is waiting on it).
